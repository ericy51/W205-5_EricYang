I ranked the hospitals based on three categories of measures: readmissions/mortality,
effective care, and timely care.  First I looked at readmissions/mortality measures,
ranking hospital performance based on the lowest percentages of mortality and
readmissions across multiple measures.  Similarly I ranked hospitals across the
effective care measures which were rate measures.  Higher rates being positive
indicators in this case.  Lastly I ranked hospitals across timely care measures
with the best hospitals having the lowest time to perform a service.  Using these
three rankings I derived an average overall rank to determine final weight.
If hospitals had the same score across any list (tied scores),the hospital with 
the most observations was ranked higher.

The overall method is appropriate because it takes the three main measures of
quality: effective care, mortality/readmissions, and timeliness of care to create a
average rank in order to get a thorough idea of hospital quality.
