For the best states ranking I used a similar approach as hospitals.  I generated
three lists of rankings based on the measure groups: readmissions/mortality,
effective care, and timely care.  This produced three lists of rankings by
states.  I then took the average of the three list to get an overall ranking
by state.  I incorporated two different tables for the state measures:
readmissions_state_final and effective_care_state_final.  This showed the
aggregate score by measure and by state.  The readmissions table had slightly
different information than the hospital level data.  It provided the number of
hospitals better than average.  To derive a score I ranked states with the
highest % of hospitals that scored better.  Overall this method achieves the
goal of defining quality by using all measures applicable to hospital care.
