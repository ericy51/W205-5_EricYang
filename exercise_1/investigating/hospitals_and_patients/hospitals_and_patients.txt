I found little correlation between patient scores and hospital quality.  For the
survey data I ranked hospitals using the hcahps_base_score from the hcahps data.
I compared the top 500 hospitals to the top 500 hospitals in my list of overall
hospital rankings based on the measures and found little cross over between the
lists.  Out of each of the top 500 lists only 46 matched, or 9.2% crossover
for the top 500.  The full list of cross over can be found in the table
survey_crossover_quality.  The method gives a general sense of how patient
responses correlate with overall CMS data.

I found little correlation between patient consistency scores and prodcedural
variability measures.  For the survey data I ranked hospitals using the
hcahps_consistency_score from the hcahps data.  I compared the top 500 hospitals
to the top 500 hospitals in my list of overall hospital variability rankings
based on the measures and found little cross over between the lists.  Out of
each of the top 500 lists only 35 matched or 7% crossover for the top 500.  The
full list of cross over can be found in the table survey_crossover_variability.
Again this method gives a general sense of how patientresponses correlate with
overall CMS data.
