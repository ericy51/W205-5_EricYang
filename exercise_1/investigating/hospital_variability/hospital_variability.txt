To understand variability between procedures across hospitals I took a list of
select measures from the effective_care_final table.  I used measures that begin
with the following strings 'OP%','SCIP%','STK%',VTE%','AMI%'.  This gives us a
list of rates.  I then looked at the variance between hospitals and ranked by
highest variance to get a list of the top 10.  This method is appropriate because
it takes into account all hospitals and there performance for all the procedures
not related to time.
